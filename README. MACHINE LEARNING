## Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project trains a machine learning model to predict customer churn from CSV data and serves predictions via a FastAPI API.

### Features
- CSV data ingestion
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering
- Random Forest model training
- Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
- Model artifact persistence
- FastAPI prediction service with input validation
- Simple HTML dashboard with model metrics and top feature importances
- Logging and error handling

### Project Structure
```
churn_prediction/
├── artifacts/                 # Saved model, metrics, and feature importances
├── churn_prediction.py         # Training + FastAPI app (single file)
└── requirements.txt
```

### Setup
```bash
cd churn_prediction
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Train the Model
```bash
python churn_prediction.py train --csv /path/to/churn_data.csv --target churn
```

Artifacts are saved to `churn_prediction/artifacts/`:
- `churn_model.joblib`
- `metrics.json`
- `feature_importances.csv`
- `schema.json`

### Run the API
```bash
uvicorn churn_prediction:app --reload
```

### Example Prediction Request
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/predict" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data": {"gender": "Female", "tenure": 12, "monthly_charges": 70.5, "total_charges": 845.0}}'
```

### Dashboard
Open `http://localhost:8000/dashboard` in your browser to see model metrics and the top 5 feature importances.

### Notes
- Ensure your input payload contains all feature columns from the training dataset.
- The API will return an error if required fields are missing.
